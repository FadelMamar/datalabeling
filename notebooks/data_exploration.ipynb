    "- ```-ratioheight``` : proportion of tile  w.r.t height of image. Example 0.5 means dividing the image in two bands w.r.t height.\n",
    "- ```-ratiowidth``` : proportion of tile w.r.t to width of image. Example 1.0 means the width of the tile is the same as the image.\n",
    "- ```-overlapfactor``` : percentage of overlap. It should be less than 1.\n",
    "- ```-rmheight``` : percentage of height to remove or crop at bottom and top\n",
    "- ```-rmwidth``` : percentage of width to remove or crop on each side of the image\n",
    "- ```-pattern``` : \"**/*.JPG\" will get all .JPG images in directory and subdirectories. On windows it will get both .JPG and .jpg. On unix it will only get .JPG images\n"
